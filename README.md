# Roman

This is a simple package to handle the conversion of Roman numerals to/from their integer form.

## Ruleset

There is very little concensus around what constitutes a valid representation of an integer in Roman numerals. I have gone with the rules below:

 - only the characters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are valid
 - powers of 10 (I, X, C, and M) can only repeat three times
 - powers of 5 cannot repeat
 - numerals (or valid pairs) should appear in decending order

As there are still cases where the rules above allow for multiple alternative representations of a number, the `IsValid(s string, strict bool)` method allows for strict mode.

In strict mode, an additional check is performed to enure the Roman representation provided matches that generated by the `FromInt(i int)` function.

For example:

| Input | Commonly Accepted Form | Integer | Strict Mode | Valid |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| CXXX  | CXXX                   | 130     | false       | true  |
| XCXL  | CXXX                   | 130     | true        | false |
